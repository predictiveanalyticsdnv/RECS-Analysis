# RECS Analysis

This notebook demonstrates code structuring for Python projects which use Jupyter notebooks.
The template Jupyter notebook demonstrates markdown functionality which can be used for documentation.
The modules in PyLib are used to save functions which you want to externalize from the notebook.
This can help to keep your Jupyter notebooks concise, even if you are using longer functions.

## Getting Started

Get started by cloning this repository onto your local machine. The following steps assume that you have already installed Anaconda on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/predictiveanalyticsdnv/RECS-Analysis.git
```

2. Create a new branch. Name your branch according to the following convention : contributions-YOURINITIALS
```
git checkout -b contributions-bdj
```

3. Copy the template analysis file, and rename using the following convention : PX - Analysis Title - YOURINITIALS.ipynb. Your repository should now resemble the file structure below.
```bash
.
├── RECS-Analysis
│	├── README.md
│	├── Jupyter Notebooks
│	│	├── P1 - Template Analysis.ipynb
│	│	├── P2 - Analysis Title - BDJ.ipynb
```

4. Create your own analysis of the RECS data. Have fun!
